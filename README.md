# kuks
Loads Data Set and exposes API's to perform basic operations like summation of columns, difference/product/sum of lists ..

===================
Tasks Performed:

1. Data Collection

2. Summation of a variable list

3. Sum, Product and Difference between ‘N’ variable lists

-------------------

Data Collection:

Assuming the incoming data is in a ‘.csv’ form, we read the incoming data into a reader instance through

a class called Invoker where the DataReader function reads and the function displayDataset displays

the data.
-------------------

Summation of a variable list:

The function will get a single variable in a list form. The output of this function is a single double value

corresponding to the sum of each entry of the list.

Function name: Summation

----------------------

Sum, Product and Difference between ‘N’ variable lists:
-------------
Sum of ‘N’ variable lists:

The function will get two variable lists. The output of this function is a single variable list corresponding

to the sum of the two variable lists.

Function name: sumOfLists

------------
Product of ‘N’ variable lists:

The function will get two variable lists. The output of this function is a single variable list corresponding

to the product of the two variable lists.

Function name: prodOfLists

------------
Difference between ‘N’ variable lists:

The function will get two variable lists. The output of this function is a single variable list corresponding

to the difference between the two variable lists.

Function name: diffOfLists
